# 3 Key Derivation with python

## 3.1 Example 1

PBKDF2 is a python class that takes 5 arguments : passphrase, salt, iterations, digestmodule and macmodule. It is define this way :

```
class PBKDF2 (
    passphrase: str,
    salt: bytes,
    iterations: int = 1000,
    digestmodule: Any | ((string: ReadableBuffer = b"", *, usedforsecurity: bool = True) -> _Hash) | Module("sha") = SHA1,
    macmodule: Any | Module("hmac") = HMAC
) 
 ```

Passphrase, salt and iterations are required arguments for PBKDF2 functions.

## 3.2 Example 2

PBKDF2_HMAC is a python function that takes 5 arguments : hash_name, paassword, salt, iterations, dklen. The required parameters are hash_name, password, salt, iterations.

```
def pbkdf2_hmac(
    hash_name: Any,
    password: Any,
    salt: Any,
    iterations: Any,
    dklen: Any | None = None
) -> bytes 
```

# 4 Symmetric Encryption
## 4.1 Example 1
An encryption algorithm is a mathematical procedure used to convert plain text into ciphertext, making it unreadable to unauthorized individuals. It ensures the confidentiality and integrity of data by scrambling the information using a specific algorithm and a secret key.

The key size refers to the length of the key used in the encryption algorithm. It determines the strength of the encryption and the number of possible keys that can be used. Generally, a larger key size implies stronger encryption and increased security.

A mode of operation is a technique used to apply the encryption algorithm to encrypt or decrypt data in blocks or streams. It defines how multiple blocks of data are processed to achieve confidentiality and data integrity. Common modes of operation include Electronic Codebook (ECB), Cipher Block Chaining (CBC), Counter (CTR), and Galois/Counter Mode (GCM), among others.

The size of the output is 256 bits(bits), so 32 bytes (octets).

## 4.2 Example 2

Same as 4.1 ðŸ¥³

# 5 Hash Function with python 

SHA-256:
Hash function: hashlib.sha256()
Output size: 256 bits or 32 bytes
Calculation: hashlib.sha256(b'hello').digest()

SHA3-256:
Hash function: hashlib.sha3_256()
Output size: 256 bits or 32 bytes
Calculation: ``hashlib.sha3_256(b'hello').digest()

BLAKE2s:
Hash function: hashlib.new('blake2s')
Output size: Variable (default is 256 bits or 32 bytes)
Calculation: ```hashlib.new('blake2s', b'hello').digest()```

## 5.2 Example 1 & 5.3 Example 2

Output obtain with the example 1

SHA-256: b'2cf24dba5fb0a30e26e83b2ac5b9e29e1b161e5c1fa7425e73043362938b9824'

SHA3-256: b'3338be694f50c5f338814986cdf0686453a888b84f424d792af4b9202398f392'

BLAKE2s:  b'19213bacc58dee6dbde3ceb9a47cbb330b3d86f8cca8997eb00be456f140ca25'

Output obtain with the example 2

SHA-256:  b'2cf24dba5fb0a30e26e83b2ac5b9e29e1b161e5c1fa7425e73043362938b9824'
SHA3-256: b'3338be694f50c5f338814986cdf0686453a888b84f424d792af4b9202398f392'
BLAKE2s:  b'19213bacc58dee6dbde3ceb9a47cbb330b3d86f8cca8997eb00be456f140ca25'

## 5.4 Example 3

RIPEMD-160 produces a hash value with an output size of 160 bits or 20 bytes.
Keccak256 (SHA3-256) produces a hash value with an output size of 256 bits or 32 bytes.

Keccak256 and SHA3-256 are not exactly equivalent, although they are closely related. Keccak is a cryptographic sponge construction, and SHA3 is the winning algorithm of the NIST hash function competition, which is based on the Keccak construction. SHA3-256 is one specific variant of the Keccak family, which produces a 256-bit hash output. While they share similarities, they are not interchangeable in all contexts.

# 6 Prerequisites, again
- DSA: Signature algorithm

- Blake2s: Hash function

- CTR: Mode of operation

- ECDH: Key exchange algorithm

- curve25519: Elliptic curve used in cryptography

RSA-2048, 2048 refers to the size of the modulus used to generate the RSA public and private key pair. The modulus is a large number that is the product of two large prime numbers. It is used to compute both the public and private keys.

The public key of RSA is made up of the modulus and a public exponent. The public exponent is a small integer that is chosen randomly and kept public. The private key of RSA is made up of the modulus and the inverse of the public exponent. The inverse of the public exponent is a large integer that is kept secret.

To encrypt a message with RSA, the sender uses the recipient's public key. To decrypt a message with RSA, the recipient uses their private key.

Therefore, when we say RSA-2048, we are referring to a RSA key pair where the modulus (n) is 2048 bits long. The actual size of the private key may be larger than the public key due to the additional values it contains. 
``` 
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
RSAPrivateKey ::= SEQUENCE {
  version           Version,
  modulus           INTEGER,  -- n
  publicExponent    INTEGER,  -- e
  privateExponent   INTEGER,  -- d
  prime1            INTEGER,  -- p
  prime2            INTEGER,  -- q
  exponent1         INTEGER,  -- d mod (p-1)
  exponent2         INTEGER,  -- d mod (q-1)
  coefficient       INTEGER,  -- (inverse of q) mod p
  otherPrimeInfos   OtherPrimeInfos OPTIONAL
}
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
```

``` 
-----BEGIN RSA PUBLIC KEY-----
RSAPublicKey ::= SEQUENCE {
    modulus           INTEGER,  -- n
    publicExponent    INTEGER   -- e
}
-----END RSA PUBLIC KEY-----
```


We had test the size of the RSA-2048 private key using this command :

``` openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out test-privateKey-RSA2048.pem -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048 ```


``` openssl rsa -in test-privateKey-RSA2048.pem -pubout -out public_key.pem```

We can see that the size of the private is larger than the size of public key. (e.g : test-public_key-RSA2048.pem ans test-privateKey-RSA2048)
